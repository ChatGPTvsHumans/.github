In this study, we delve into whether ChatGPT can be a useful tool for web developers. For this study, we employed a comparative method with multiple experiments to investigate ChatGPT's potential and applications in web development. We chose to examine four areas that are prevalent in web development. These areas were code generation, code completion, code optimization, and code debugging.

We constructed various prompts for the experiments we conducted. To assess ChatGPT's potential and applications in web development, we performed several experiments that involved testing ChatGPT's ability to generate code, optimize code, and solve coding problems. The results of these experiments indicate that ChatGPT is capable of generating code, providing suggestions for code optimization, and resolving coding problems. However, we also observed limitations in ChatGPT's ability to generate more advanced functionalities.

Based on this study, we can conclude that ChatGPT has potential and capabilities. In theory, the use of generative AI could contribute to streamlining various tasks and potentially take over monotonous tasks. In its current version, ChatGPT can only serve as an assistant, but its future is likely to have an impact on web development.
